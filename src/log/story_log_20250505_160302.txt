Lily the lamb was a very curious lamb.  One evening, as the sun began to set, painting the city park in pretty twilight colours, Lily wandered away from her flock.  The rustling leaves whispered secrets in the gentle breeze, and the fountain nearby chuckled softly, but Lily felt lost and a little bit scared.  She missed her fluffy friends!

Suddenly, a tiny light flickered near her. It was Finley, a firefly with a bright, cheerful glow.  At first, Lily jumped! But Finley’s light was so gentle and kind, it calmed her down.  "Don't worry," Finley twinkled. "I'll help you."

Finley led Lily through the whispering leaves to a hidden part of the park.  There, amongst the trees, were big, colourful building blocks!  They were old and slightly dusty, but they looked like fun.  "Let's build a tower!" Finley buzzed excitedly.  "A really tall one, so your flock can see us!"

Lily, who loved building things almost as much as she loved exploring, agreed.  They worked together, carefully placing the blocks, one on top of the other.  Lily, with her soft wool, helped keep the tower steady while Finley, with his tiny legs, scampered up and down, checking everything was straight.  It was hard work, but so much fun!

Finally, the tower stood tall and proud!  Then, Finley did something magical. He used his bright light to make the tower glow.  It shimmered and shone against the twilight sky, a beacon of hope for Lily.

Soon, Lily saw them!  Her fluffy flock, their woolly bodies silhouetted against the darkening sky, were running towards the glowing tower.  Lily baaed with joy!  She was reunited with her family.

Lily and Finley celebrated their success.  Their tower stood tall, a bright symbol of their friendship and the amazing things they could do together.  Finley, with his tiny light, guided Lily back to her flock. It was time to say goodnight.  Lily snuggled close to her family, her heart full of happiness.  She knew she'd never forget her adventure and her new friend, Finley the firefly.
