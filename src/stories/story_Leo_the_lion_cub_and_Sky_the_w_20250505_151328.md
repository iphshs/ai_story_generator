Leo the lion cub shivered as the sun dipped low, painting the Whispering Savannah in shades of orange and purple. Long shadows stretched from the acacia trees, looking like spooky monsters to little Leo. 'Oh dear,' he whispered, tucking his head under his paws.

Suddenly, a soft 'Hoo-hoo?' came from above. Leo peeked out and saw Sky, a kind owl with big, round eyes, perched on a branch. 'What troubles you, little one?' she asked gently.

'The dark! It's full of scary shapes,' Leo whimpered.

Sky hooted softly. 'The night has its own beauty, Leo. Come, let's see.' Tentatively, Leo followed Sky. Tiny fireflies blinked around them like floating jewels. The sweet scent of night flowers filled the air. 'Wow,' Leo breathed. But then, a leaf rustled loudly! Leo jumped. 'It's just the wind, little lion,' Sky explained patiently. She pointed her wing upwards. 'Look!'

Above them, the sky was filled with twinkling stars, like diamonds scattered on dark velvet. Leo stared, forgetting his fear. The night wasn't scary; it was beautiful and peaceful.

'Thank you, Sky,' Leo yawned, feeling brave now. He found a soft patch of grass and curled up, watching the stars until he drifted off to sleep.
