Lily the lamb loved to explore. One evening, as the sun set, painting the sky with pretty colours, Lily wandered from her flock.  She felt a little lost but wasn't scared.

Suddenly, she saw a tiny light! It was Finley, a firefly, twinkling gently.  "Hello," Finley said. "Lost?"

Finley guided Lily through the trees.  They found big, colorful blocks! "Let's build a tower!" Finley buzzed.

Lily loved building! They worked together, carefully placing each block.  The tower grew taller and taller.  Finley’s light made it sparkle!

Lily’s flock saw the sparkling tower and came running. Lily was so happy to see them!

Lily and Finley smiled. Their tower shone brightly.  Finley flew Lily back to her flock.  Lily snuggled close, happy and sleepy. She'd made a new friend and built a wonderful tower!
